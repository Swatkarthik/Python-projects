                Exploratory Data Analysis on Oil and Gas Prices

Products: ['Brent Oil', 'Crude Oil WTI', 'Natural Gas', 'Heating Oil']

1.There are a number of interesting observations to note. First, crude oil has been the most 
traded commodity amongst the four until 2020 when it was overtaken by Brent Oil, experiencing
its lowest in 2021 (with an average traded volume of about 4521 barrels per day). Also, it 
can be seen that from the initial years, there is a struggle between Brent Oil and Natural Gas 
for dominance. While Natural Gas had it in from 2000 to 2003, Brent Oil took over in 2003 and has 
since beaten Natural Gas to the fight. Heating Oil remains the least traded for obvious reasons, I 
believe.

2. Thus, it can be inferred that there is little association between the volumes traded 
and the closing price, both for the individual products and all of them combined.

3.Thus, until about 2010, Crude Oil from WTI often had the highest prices. Following then, 
Brent Oil almost always remained atop. Furthermore, Heating Oil seem to have had somewhat
steady prices over the years. Natural Gas, on the other hand, show a sporadic behaviour from 
2000 to 2012, and then takes a journey stable movement from thenceforth.
